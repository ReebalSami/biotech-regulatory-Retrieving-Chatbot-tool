This regulation sets forth requirements for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing of medical devices. Given the critical nature of the device, ensuring compliance with the QSR is essential to guarantee its safety and effectiveness in healthcare settings. Additionally, considering the need for sterilization and the duration of body contact, adherence to standards related to sterilization processes and biocompatibility testing would be crucial aspects to address in order to meet regulatory requirements and ensure patient safety.",
