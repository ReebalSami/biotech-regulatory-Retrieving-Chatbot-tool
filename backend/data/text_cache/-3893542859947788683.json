worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization. International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISOIEC Directives, Part 2. The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an International Standard requires approval by at least 75  of the member bodies casting a vote. Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights. ISO 10993-5 was prepared by Technical Committee ISOTC 194, Biological evaluation of medical devices . This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition (ISO 10993-5:1999) which has been technically revised.

This should lead to the selection of the most appropriate test. Three categories of test are listed: extract test, direct contact test, indirect contact test. The choice of one or more of these categories depends upon the nature of the sample to be evaluated, the potential site of use and the nature of the use. This choice then determines the details of the preparation of the samples to be tested, the preparation of the cultured cells, and the way in which the cells are exposed to the samples or their extracts. At the end of the exposure time, the evaluation of the presence and extent of the cytotoxic effect is undertaken. It is the intention of this part of ISO 10993 to leave open the choice of type of evaluation. Such a strategy makes available a battery of tests, which reflects the approach of many groups that advocate in vitro biological tests. The numerous methods used and endpoints measured in cytotoxicity determination can be grouped into the following categories of evaluation:  assessments of cell damage by morphological means;  measurements of cell damage;  measurements of cell growth;  measurements of specific aspects of cellular metabolism. There are several means of producing results in each of these four categories. The investigator should be aware of the test categories and into which category a particular technique fits, in order that comparisons be able to be made with other results on similar devices or materials both at the intra- and interlaboratory level. Examples of quantitative test protocols are given in annexes. Guidance for the interpretation of the results is given in this part of ISO 10993.

These methods specify the incubation of cultured cells in contact with a device andor extracts of a device either directly or through diffusion. These methods are designed to determine the biological response of mammalian cells in vitro using appropriate biological parameters. 2 Normative references The following referenced documents are indispensable for the application of this document. For dated references, only the edition cited applies. For undated references, the latest edition of the referenced document (including any amendments) applies. ISO 10993-1, Biological evaluation of medical devices  Part 1: Evaluation and testing within a risk management system ISO 10993-12, Biological evaluation of medical devices  Part 12: Sample preparation and reference materials 3 Terms and definitions For the purposes of this document, the terms and definitions given in ISO 10993-1 and the following apply. 3.1 culture vessels vessels appropriate for cell culture including glass petri dishes, plastic culture flasks or plastic multiwells and microtitre plates NOTE These can be used interchangeably in these methods provided that they meet the requirements of tissue culture grade and are suitable for use with mammalian cells. 3.2 positive control material material which, when tested in accordance with this part of ISO 10993, provides a reproducible cytotoxic response Copyright International Organization for Standardization Provided by IHS under license with ISO LicenseeIstanbul Teknik Universtesi5956919001, UserJicheng, Piao Not for Resale, 06112009 16:45:28 MDT No reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS --``,,,,,,,,,,``,,````,,,````,,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- ISO 10993-5:2009(E) 2  ISO 2009  All rights reserved NOTE The purpose of the positive control is to demonstrate an appropriate test system response. For example, an organotin-stabilized polyurethane1) has been used as positive control for solid materials and extracts. Dilutions of phenol, for example, have been used as a positive control for extracts . In addition to a material, pure chemicals can also be used to demonstrate the performance of the test system. 3.3 blank extraction vehicle not containing the test sample, retained in a vessel identical to that which holds the test sample and subjected to conditions identical to those to which the test sample is subjected during its extraction NOTE The purpose of the blank is to evaluate the possible confounding effects due to the extraction vessel, vehicle and extraction process. 3.4 negative control material material which, when tested in accordance with this part of ISO 10993, does not produce a cytotoxic response NOTE The purpose of the negative control is to demonstrate background response of the cells. For example, high-density polyethylene2) for synthetic polymers, and aluminium oxide ceramic rods for dental material have been used as negative controls. 3.5 test sample material, device, device portion, component, extract or portion thereof that is subjected to biological or chemical testing or evaluation 3.6 subconfluency approximately 80  confluency, i.e. the end of the logarithmic phase of growth 4 Sample and control preparation 4.1 General The test shall be performed on a) an extract of the test sample andor b) the test sample itself. Sample preparation shall be in accordance with ISO 10993-12. Negative and positive controls shall be included in each assay. 1) The ZDEC and ZDBC polyurethanes are available from the F ood and Drug Safety Center, Hatano Research Institute, Ochiai 729-5, Hadanoshi, Kanagawa 257, Japan. 2) High-density polyethylene can be obtained from the U.S. Pharmacopeia (Rockville, MD, USA) and from the Food and Drug Safety Center, Hatano Research Institute (Ochiai 729-5, Hadanoshi, Kanagawa 257, Japan). The information given in 1) and 2) is for the convenience of the user of this part of ISO 10993 and does not constitute an endorsement by ISO of these products.

Due to the nature of certain materials (e.g. biodegradable materials), alteration of the chemical structure can occur during the extraction procedure. NOTE The concentration of any endogenous or extraneous substances in the extract, and hence the amount exposed to the test cells, depends on the interfacial area, the extraction volume, pH, chemical solubility, diffusion rate, osmolarity, agitation, temperature, time and other factors. For devices that involve mixing two or more components in the patient to arrive at the final device (for example bone cement), the final device should not be washed prior to extraction. Washing the test sample can reduce or remove residuals present on the device. If the test sample is to be used in a sterile environment, a sterilized test sample should be used to extract chemical constituents. 4.2.2 Extraction vehicle The choice of the extraction vehicle(s) taking into account the chemical characteristics of the test sample shall be justified and documented. For mammalian cell assays one or more of the following vehicles shall be used: a) culture medium with serum; b) physiological saline solution; c) other suitable vehicle. The choice of vehicle should reflect the aim of the extraction. Consideration shall be given to the use of both a polar and a non-polar vehicle. Culture medium with serum is the preferred extraction vehicle. The use of culture medium with serum is preferred for extraction because of its ability to support cellular growth as well as extract both polar and non-polar substances. In addition to culture medium with serum, use of medium without serum should be considered in order to specifically extract polar substances (e.g. ionic compounds). Other suitable vehicles include purified water and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). DMSO is cytotoxic in selected assay systems at greater than 0,5  (volume fraction). The cellular exposure concentration of extractables in DMSO will be lower due to the greater dilution as compared to extraction in culture medium with serum. NOTE 1 Different types of serum (e.g. foetal, bovinecalf serum, newborn calf serum) might be used and the choice of the serum is dependent on the cell type. NOTE 2 It is important to recognise that serumprotei ns are known to bind, to some extent, extractables. 4.2.3 Extraction conditions 4.2.3.1 The extraction shall be performed in sterile, chemically inert, closed containers by using aseptic techniques, in accordance with ISO 10993-12. 4.2.3.2 With the exception of circumstances given below, the extraction shall be conducted under one of the following conditions and shall be applied according to the device characteristics and specific conditions for use: a) (24  2) h at (37  1) C; b) (72  2) h at (50  2) C; c) (24  2) h at (70  2) C; d) (1  0,2) h at (121  2) C.

Other conditions, e.g. prolonged or shortened extraction times at 37 C, which simulate the extraction that occurs during clinical use or provide an adequate measure of the hazard potential, may be used, but shall be justified and documented. For medical devices that are in short-term contact (no greater than 4 h cumulative contact duration) with intact skin or mucosa and that are not implanted, this may include extraction times of less than 24 h but no less than 4 h, as given in a) to c). Cell culture medium with serum should only be used in accordance with a) because extraction temperatures greater than (37  1) C can adversely impact chemistry andor stability of the serum and other constituents in the culture medium. For polymeric test samples, the extraction temperature should not exceed the glass transition temperature as the higher temperature can change the extractant composition. 4.2.3.3 If the extract is filtered, centrifuged or processed by other methods prior to being applied to the cells, these details shall be recorded in the final report along with a rationale for the additional steps (see Clause 9). Any pH adjustment of the extract shall be reported. Manipulation of the extract, such as by pH adjustment, should be avoided because it could influence the result. 4.3 Preparation of material for direct-contact tests 4.3.1 Form of test samples Materials that have various shapes, sizes or physical states (i.e. liquid, gels, solids, etc.) may be tested without modification in the cytotoxicity assays. The preferred test sample of a solid material should have at least one flat surface. If not, adjustments shall be made to achieve flat surfaces. 4.3.2 Sterility of test samples 4.3.2.1 Sterility of the test sample shall be taken into account. 4.3.2.2 Test samples from sterilized devices shall be handled aseptically throughout the test procedure. 4.3.2.3 Test samples from devices that are normally supplied non-sterile but are sterilized before use shall be sterilized by the method recommended by the manufacturer and handled aseptically throughout the test procedure. The effect of sterilization methods or agents on the device should be considered in defining the preparation of the test sample prior to use in the test system. 4.3.2.4 Test samples from devices not required to be sterile in use shall be used as supplied and handled aseptically throughout the test procedure. It may be justifiable to sterilize the test material in order to avoid microbial contamination of the cell culture; however, the sterilization process shall not alter the properties of the test material. If non-sterile test samples are used, they should be checked for bacterial contamination because the contamination can lead to a false assessment of cytotoxicity. 4.3.3 Liquid test samples Liquid test samples shall be tested by either a) direct deposition or b) deposition on a biologically inert absorbent matrix. Filter discs have bee n found to be suitable for us e as iner t absorbent matrices.

Where specific sensitivity is required, primary cell cultures, cell lines and organotypic cultures obtained directly from living tissues shall only be used if reproducibility and accuracy of the response can be demonstrated. If a stock culture of a cell line is stored, storage shall be at 80 C or below in the corresponding culture medium but containing a cryoprotectant, e.g. dimethylsu lfoxide or glycerol. Long-term storage (several months up to many years) is only possible at 130 C or below. Only cells free from mycoplasma shall be used for the test. Before use, stock cultures should be tested for the absence of mycoplasma. It is important to check cells regularly (e.g. morphology, doubling time, modal chromosome number) because sensitivity in tests can vary with passage number. Good cell culture practices should be used. See Reference [5]. 6 Culture medium The culture medium shall be sterile. The culture medium with or without serum shall meet the growth requirements of the selected cell line. Antibiotics may be included in the medium provided that they do not adversely affect the assays. Storage conditions shall be validated. NOTE The stability of the culture medium varies with the composition and storage conditions. The culture medium shall be maintained at a pH of between 7,2 and 7,4. 3) For example, cell lines American Type Culture Collection CCL 1 (NCTC clone 929), CCL 163 (Balb3T3 clone A31), CCL 171 (MRC-5) and CCL 75 (WI-38), CCL 81 (Vero) and CCL 10 [BHK-21 (C-13) ] and V-79 379A are endorsed by ISO experts to be suitable. This information is given for the convenience of the user of this part of ISO 10993 and does not constitute an endorsement by ISO of the products named. Other cell lines may be used if they can be shown to lead to the same or more relevant results.

If the cells are to be grown from cultures taken from storage, remove the cryoprotectant, if present. Subculture the cells at least once before use. When subculturing cells, remove and resuspend the cells by enzymatic andor mechanical disaggregation using a method appropriate for the cell line. 8 Test procedures 8.1 Number of replicates A minimum of three replicates shall be used for test samples and controls. 8.2 Test on extracts 8.2.1 This test allows both qualitative and quantitative assessment of cytotoxicity. 8.2.2 Pipette an aliquot of the continuously stirred cell suspension into each of a sufficient number of vessels for exposure to the extracts. Distribute the cells evenly over the surface of each vessel by gentle rotation. 8.2.3 Incubate the cultures at (37  1) C in air with or without carbon dioxide as appropriate for the buffer system chosen for the culture medium. The test should be performed on a subconfluent monolayer or on freshly suspended cells. In the colony-forming assay only an appropriate low cell density shall be used. 8.2.4 Verify the subconfluency and the morphology of the cultures with a microscope before starting the test. In exceptional cases, exponentially growing cells (e.g. primary cells, high proliferating cells) may be seeded at the starting point of the test. 8.2.5 Perform the test on a) the original extract andor b) the original extract and a dilution series of the extracts using the extract vehicle as diluent. Alternatively, where materials of limited solubility are known or suspected to be present, dilution should be achieved by varying the original extraction ratio of test sample to extraction medium. If monolayers are used for the test, remove and discard the culture medium from the cultures and add an aliquot of the extract or dilution thereof into each of the vessels. If suspended cells are used for the test, add the extract or dilution thereof into each of the replicate vessels, immediately after preparation of the cell suspension. 8.2.6 When a non-physiological extract is used, e.g. water, the extract shall be tested at the highest physiologically compatible concentration after dilution in culture medium. NOTE Concentrated culture medium, e.g. 2 , 5, is recommended for use in diluting aqueous extracts.

NOTE A fresh culture medium control can also be tested, if appropriate. 8.2.8 Incubate the vessels using the same conditions as described in 8.2.3 for an appropriate interval corresponding to the selected specific assay. 8.2.9 After an incubation period of at least 24 h, determine the cytotoxic effects in accordance with 8.5. 8.3 Test by direct contact 8.3.1 This test allows both qualitative and quantitative assessment of cytotoxicity. 8.3.2 Pipette a known aliquot of the continuously stirred cell suspension into each of a sufficient number of vessels for direct exposure to the test sample. Distribute the cells evenly over the surface of each vessel by gentle horizontal rotation. 8.3.3 Incubate the culture at (37  1) C in air, with or without carbon dioxide as appropriate for the buffer system chosen for the culture medium, until the cultures have grown to subconfluency. 8.3.4 Verify the subconfluency and the morphology of the cultures with a microscope before starting the test. In exceptional cases, exponentially growing cells (e.g. primary cells, high proliferating cells) may be seeded at the starting point of the test. 8.3.5 Remove and discard the culture medium. Then add fresh culture medium to each vessel. 8.3.6 Carefully place individual specimens of the test sample on the cell layer in the centre of each of the replicate vessels. Ensure that the specimen covers approximately one tenth of the cell layer surface. Other ratios of specimen surface to cell layer surface may be used if justified. Exercise care to prevent unnecessary movement of the specimens, as this could cause physical trauma to the cells. For example, patches of dislodged cells can result from unnecessary movement. NOTE When appropriate, the specimen can be placed in the culture vessel prior to the addition of the cells. 8.3.7 Prepare replicate vessels for both the negative control and positive control material. 8.3.8 Incubate the vessels under the same conditions as described in 8.3.3 for an appropriate interval (a minimum of 24 h) corresponding to the selected specific assay. 8.3.9 Discard the supernatant culture medium before adding chemicalsdyes in order to determine the cytotoxic effects in accordance with 8.5. 8.4 Test by indirect contact 8.4.1 Agar diffusion 8.4.1.1 This test allows a qualitative assessment of cytotoxicity. This assay is not appropriate for leachables that cannot diffuse through the agar layer, or that may react with agar. The use of the agar diffusion assay for the assessment of cytotoxicity shall be justified. 8.4.1.2 Pipette a known aliquot of the continuously stirred cell suspension into each of a sufficient number of replicate vessels for the test. Distribute the cells evenly over the surface of each vessel by gentle horizontal rotation.

Then mix fresh culture medium containing serum with melted agar to obtain a final mass concentration of agar of 0,5  to 2  and pipette an appropriate volume into each vessel. Use only agar that is suitable for the growth of mammalian cells in culture. The agarculture medium mixture should be in a liquid state and at a temperature that is compatible with mammalian cells. NOTE Agar is available in various molecular weight ranges and purities. 8.4.1.6 Carefully place replicate specimens of the test sample on the solidified agar layer in each vessel. Ensure that the specimen covers approximately one tenth of the cell layer surface. Other ratios of specimen surface to cell layer surface may be used if justified. Pre-soak any absorbent material with the culture medium before placing it on the agar to prevent dehydration of the agar. 8.4.1.7 Prepare replicate vessels with both the negative control and positive control material. 8.4.1.8 Incubate the vessels using the same conditions as described in 8.4.1.3 for 24 h to 72 h. 8.4.1.9 Examine the cells to determine cytotoxic effect before and after carefully removing the specimens from the agar. Use of a vital stain, e.g. neutral red, can aid in the detection of cytotoxicity. The vital stain may be added before or after the incubation with the specimen. If the stain is added before the incubation, protect the cultures from light to prevent cell damage elicited by photoactivation of the stain. 8.4.2 Filter diffusion 8.4.2.1 This test allows a qualitative assessment of cytotoxicity. 8.4.2.2 Place a surfactant-free filter with 0,45 µm pore size into each vessel and add a known aliquot of the continuously stirred cell suspension into each of a sufficient number of replicate vessels for the test. Distribute the cells evenly over the surface of each filter by gentle rotation. 8.4.2.3 Incubate the cultures at (37  1) C in air, with or without carbon dioxide as appropriate for the buffer system chosen for the culture medium, until the cultures have grown to approximate subconfluency at the end of the logarithmic phase of the growth curve. 8.4.2.4 Remove and discard the culture medium from the vessels. Then transfer the filters, cell side down, on to a layer of solidified agar (see 8.4.1.5). 8.4.2.5 Carefully place the replicate specimens of the test sample on the acellular (top) side of the filter. Retain liquid extracts and freshly mixed compounds in non-reactive rings placed on the filter. 8.4.2.6 Prepare replicate filters with both the negative control and positive control material. 8.4.2.7 Incubate the vessels using the same conditions described in 8.4.2.3 for 2 h  10 min. 8.4.2.8 Carefully remove the specimens from the filter and carefully separate the filter from the agar surface. 8.4.2.9 Determine the cytotoxic effects using an appropriate stain procedure.

Quantitative evaluation of cytotoxicity is preferable. Qualitative means are appropriate for screening purposes. Qualitative evaluation: Examine the cells microscopically using cytochemical staining if desired. Assess changes in, for example, general morphology, vacuolization, detachment, cell lysis and membrane integrity. The change from normal morphology shall be recorded in the test report descriptively or numerically. A useful way to grade test samples is given in Tables 1 and 2. Table 1  Qualitative morphological grading of cytotoxicity of extracts Grade Reactivity Conditions of all cultures 0 None Discrete intracytoplasmatic granules, no cell lysis, no reduction of cell growth 1 Slight Not more than 20  of the cells are round, loosely attached and without intracytoplasmatic granules, or show changes in morphology; occasional lysed cells are present; only slight growth inhibition observable. 2 Mild Not more than 50  of the cells are round, devoid of intracytoplasmatic granules, no extensive cell lysis; not more than 50  growth inhibition observable. 3 Moderate Not more than 70  of the cell layers contain rounded cells or are lysed; cell layers not completly destroyed, but more than 50  growth inhibition observable. 4 Severe Nearly complete or complete destruction of the cell layers. Table 2  Reactivity grades for agar and filter diffusion test and direct contact test Grade Reactivity Description of reactivity zone 0 None No detectable zone around or under specimen 1 Slight Some malformed or degenerated cells under specimen 2 Mild Zone limited to area under specimen 3 Moderate Zone extending specimen size up to 1,0 cm 4 Severe Zone extending farther than 1,0 cm beyond specimen The method of evaluation and the results of the evaluation shall be included in the test report. The achievement of a numerical grade greater than 2, based on Tables 1 and 2, is considered a cytotoxic effect. Quantitative evaluation: Measure cell death, inhibition of cell growth, cell proliferation or colony formation. The number of cells, amount of protein, release of enzymes, release of vital dye, reduction of vital dye or any other measurable parameter may be quantified by objective means. The objective measure and response shall be recorded in the test report. Reduction of cell viability by more than 30  is considered a cytotoxic effect. Other criteria, including different cut-off points or an acceptable ratio of test-to-control result shall be justified for alternate cell lines or multi-layered tissue constructs. The criteria shall be justified and documented. The protocols described in Annexes A to D may be used for the quantitative determination of cytotoxicity of extracts. NOTE Protocols A and B have been proven to be suitable for chemicals in international validation studies and for medical devices in an international round-robin test. For cytotoxic materials, they permit the graduation of the cytotoxic effect by the calculation of an IC50 value (inhibitory concentration estimated to affect the endpoint in question by 50 ). Annexes C and D describe other protocols widely used for the quantitative determination of cytotoxicity.

A.2 Experimental procedure A.2.1 Basic procedure BALBc 3T3 cells are seeded into 96-well plates and maintained in culture for 24 h (  1 doubling period) to form a semi-confluent monolayer (see Reference [5] for more information on cell maintenance and culture procedures). They are then exposed to the test compound over a range of concentrations. After 24 h exposure, NRU is determined for each treatment concent ration and compared to that determined in control cultures. For each treatment (i.e. concentration of the test chemical), the inhibition of growth percentage is calculated, if the extract exhibits a cytotoxic effect on the cells. The IC 50 (i.e. the concentration producing 50  reduction of NRU) is calculated from the concentration-response and expressed as a dilution percentage of the extract. The neat extract is designated as 100  extract. A.2.2 Material A.2.2.1 Cell line BALBc 3T3 cells, clone 31 (e.g. ECACC86110401, European Collection of Cell Cultures, Salisbury, Wiltshire SP4 0JG, UK; CCL-163, American Type Culture Collection [ATCC], Manassas, VA, USA) and JCRB 9005, prepared from CCL-163[ATCC], Human Science Research Resources Bank, Osaka, Japan.

A.2.3.2 Quality check of assay (I); positive control (PC) A positive control shall be included in every cytotoxicity test. With regard to the many chemicals backed by sufficient history or intra- and interlaboratory repeat tests, sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS, CAS  151-21-3) is one of the most frequently tested, and is therefore recommended as a PC. It is recommended that SLS be tested in a four-concentration scale: 0,05 mgml; 0,1 mgml; 0,15 mgml; 0,2 mgml. The historical mean, IC50, of SLS (Spielmann et. al., 1991 [10]) is 0,093 mgml. The 95  CI (confidence interval) is 0,070 mgml to 0,116 mgml. A test meets acceptance criteria, if the IC50 for SLS is within the 95  CI. The use of positive reference materials and negative reference materials is recommended [e.g. ZDEC and ZDBC (see footnote 1 on page 2 and 3.2 and 3.4)]. A.2.3.3 Quality check of assay (II); blank The absolute value (not relative to the blank) of optical density ( OD540 of NRU) obtained in the untreated blank indicates whether the 1 104 cells seeded per well have grown exponentially with normal doubling time during the two days of the assay. A test meets the acceptance criteria if the mean OD540 of blanks is W 0,3.

A test meets acceptance criteria if the left and the right mean of the blanks do not differ by more than 15  from the mean of all blanks. Checks for cell seeding errors may also be performed by examining each plate under a phase contrast microscope to ensure that cell quantity is consistent. Microscopic evaluation obviates the need for two rows of blanks. A.2.3.4 Quality check of concentration-response The IC 50 derived from the concentration-response should be supported by at least two, or if possible, three responses between 10  and 90  inhibition of NRU. If this is not the case, and the concentration progression factor can be easily reduced, reject the experiment and repeat it with a smaller progression factor. A.2.3.5 Concentrations of test sample extracts A.2.3.5.1 Range finder experiment Test eight concentrations of the sample extract by diluting the stock solution with a constant factor, covering a large range, e.g. half-log intervals. If the reduction of viability of the cell culture with the highest concentration of the sample extract is 30  or less, then the material has to be considered non-cytotoxic and no further main experiment is necessary. A.2.3.5.2 Main experiment Depending on the slope of the concentration-response curve estimated from the range finder, the dilutionprogression factor in the concentration series of the main experiment should be smaller (e.g. 610 1 ,47 ). Try to cover the relevant concentration range (between 10  and 90  effect) with at least three points of a graded effect, avoiding too many non-cytotoxic andor 100 -cytotoxic concentrations. A.2.3.6 Test procedure IMPORTANT  After thawing from stock, passage two to three times before using the cells in the test. Table A.1 shows the work flow of the test procedure. 1st day  Prepare a cell suspension of 1  105 cellsml in culture medium. Using a multichannel pipette, dispense 100 µl culture medium only into the peripheral wells of a 96-well tissue culture microtitre plate (  blanks, see Appendix E in Reference [1]). In the remaining wells, dispense 100 µl of a cell suspension of 1  105 cellsml (  1  104 cellswell). Prepare one plate per sample extract to be tested, one plate for the PC and one plate for the negative control material if available.  Incubate cells for 24 h (5  CO2, 37 C,  90  humidity) so that cells form a half-confluent monolayer. This incubation period ensures cell recovery, and adherence and progression to exponential growth phase.  Examine each plate under a phase contrast microscope to ensure that cell growth is relatively even across the microtitre plate. This check is performed to identify experimental errors.

Per well, add 100 µl of treatment medium containing either the appropriate concentration of sample extract, or the negative control, or the PC or nothing but vehicle (blank).  Incubate cells for 24 h (5  CO2, 37 C,  90  humidity). 3rd day After 24 h treatment, examine each plate under a phase contrast microscope to identify systematic cell seeding errors and growth characteristics of control and treated cells. Record changes in morphology of the cells due to cytotoxic effects of the test sample extract, but do not use these records for the calculation of the highest tolerable dose (HTD) or any other quantitative measure of cytotoxicity. Undesirable growth characteristics of control cells can indicate experimental error and can be cause for rejection of the assay. The measurement of NRU is based upon that of Ellen Borenfreund (B orenfreund and Puerner [3]). The uptake of NR into the lysosomesendosomes and vacuoles of living cells is used as a quantitative indication of cell number and viability.  Wash the cells with 150 µl pre-warmed PBS. Remove the washing solution by gentle tapping. Add 100 µl NR medium and incubate at 37 C in a humidified atmosphere of 5  CO2 for 3 h.  After incubation, remove the NR medium, and wash cells with 150 µl PBS.  Decant and blot PBS totally (optionally, centrifuge the reversed plate).  Add 150 µl NR desorb (ETOHacetic acid) solution to all wells, including blanks.  Shake the microtitre plate rapidly on a microtitre plate shaker for 10 min until NR has been extracted from the cells and forms a homogeneous solution.  Measure the absorption of the resulting coloured solution at 540 nm in a microtitre plate reader, using the blanks as a reference. Save raw data in a file format (e.g. ASCII, TXT, XLS) appropriate for further analysis of the concentration-response and calculation of IC 50. A.2.4 Data analysis A calculation of cell viability expressed as NRU is made for each concentration of the test sample extract by using the mean NRU of the six replicate values per test concentration. This value is compared with the mean NRU of all blank values (provided blanks have met the blank acceptance criteria). Relative cell viability is then expressed as a percentage of untreated blank. If achievable, the eight concentrations of each compound tested should span the range of no effect up to total inhibition of cell viability.

This can be done either by applying  a manual graphical fitting method, The use of probability paper with X  log and Y  probit scales is recommended because in most cases the concentration-response function will become almost linear in the relevant range. Semi-log paper could also be used for this technique. or  any appropriate non-linear regression procedure (preferably a Hill function4) or a logistic regression) to the concentration-response data. Before using the IC50 for further calculations, the quality of the fit should be appropriately checked. If the relative cell viability for the highest concentration of the sample extract (100  extract) is W 70  of the control group, then the material shall be considered non-cytotoxic. 4) Hill functions are monotonous and sigmoidal in shape and represent an acceptable model for many dose-response curves.

B.2.2.4.4 Preparation of sample extract Samples are extracted in accordance with ISO 10993-12, but extraction ratio of surface area per extraction volume is recommended at 6 cm2ml and that of mass per extraction volume is recommended at 0,1 gml. See References [6], [7] and [11]. The extract is separated by decantation, being the designated 100  extract. The 100  extract is diluted with MEM05 medium to give the various persentages of diluted extract. B.2.3 Methods B.2.3.1 General For routine cell culture methods, see Annex C of Reference [1].

B.2.3.5 Concentrations of test sample extracts B.2.3.5.1 Range finder experiment Test four concentrations of the sample extract by diluting the stock solution with a constant factor, covering a large range, e.g. 1 W 110 W 1100 W 11 000. If the reduction of viability of the cell culture with the highest concentration of the sample extract is 30  or less, then the material has to be considered non-cytotoxic and no further main experiment is necessary. B.2.3.5.2 Main experiment Depending on the slope of the concentration-response curve estimated from the range finder, the dilutionprogression factor in the concentration series of the main experiment should be smaller. Try to cover the relevant concentration range (between 10  and 90  effect) with at least three points of a graded effect, avoiding too many non-cytotoxic andor 100 -cytotoxic concentrations. B.2.3.6 Test procedure IMPORTANT  After thawing from stock, passage two to three times before using the cells in the test. 1st day Prepare a cell suspension of 33,3 cellsml in MEM05 medium. Place 3 ml of the suspension in each well of a 6-well plate. 2nd day After 24 h incubation, aspirate culture medium from each well. Add 2 ml of 100  or diluted extract prepared with MEM05 medium. Test each concentration in triplicate. Incubate them in the incubator for another 6 days. 8th day Aspirate the treatment medium from each well, rinse the well with PBS, fix the colonies with methanol, and stain them with 5  Giemsa solution. Count the number of colonies in each well. B.2.3.7 Presentation of results  Observe the wells using a stereomicroscope and count the number of colonies consisting of 50 or more cells in each well.  Record the number of colonies in a well.  Calculate the average colony number for each extract concentration.  Divide this number by that of the control group and express the quotient (plating efficiency: PE) as a percentage.  If the plating efficency for the highest concentration of the sample extract (100  extract) is less than 70  of the control group, the material shall be considered potentially cytotoxic and the cytotoxicity of the test samples is expressed with the IC 50 value as a percentage.

Yellow water-soluble MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromid) is metabolically reduced in viable cells to a blue-violet insoluble formazan. The number of viable cells correlates to the colour intensity determined by photometric measurements after dissolving the formazan in alcohol. C.2 Experimental procedure C.2.1 Basic procedure L929 cells are seeded into 96-well plates and maintained in culture for 24 h (  1 doubling period) to form a semi-confluent monolayer (see Reference [5] for more information on cell maintenance and culture procedures). They are then exposed to the test compound over a range of concentrations. After 24 h exposure, the formazan formation is determined for each treatment concentration and compared to that determined in control cultures. For each treatment the percentage inhibition of growth is calculated. C.2.2 Material C.2.2.1 Cell line L-929 cells (NCTC clone 929: CCL 1, American Type Culture Collection [ATCC], Manassas, VA, USA; ECACC No. 88102702, European Collection of Cell Cultures, Salisbury, Wiltshire SP4 0JG, UK).

C.2.3.2 Quality check of assay (I); positive control (PC) and negative control (NC) Positive and negative controls should be included in every cytotoxicity test. Positive and negative reference materials are recommended, e.g. ZDEC and ZDBC (see footnote 1 on page 2). C.2.3.3 Quality check of assay (II); blank The absolute value of optical density, OD570, obtained in the untreated blank indicates whether the 1  104 cells seeded per well have grown exponentially with normal doubling time during the two days of the assay. A test meets the acceptance criteria if the mean OD570 of blanks is W 0,2. To check for systematic cell seeding errors, blanks are placed both at the left side (row 2) and the right side (row 11) of the 96-well plate (row 1 and row 12 shall not be used; for plate layout, see Annex E in Reference [1]). A test meets acceptance criteria if the left and the right mean of the blanks do not differ by more than 15  from the mean of all blanks. Checks for cell seeding errors may also be performed by examining each plate under a phase contrast microscope to ensure that cell quantity is consistent. Microscopic evaluation obviates the need for two rows of blanks. C.2.3.4 Test procedure IMPORTANT  After thawing from stock, passage two to three times before using the cells in the test. Table C.1 shows the work flow of the test procedure. 1st day after growing up the cells from frozen stock  Cell cultures are removed from culture flasks by enzymatic digestion (trypsinEDTA) and the cell suspension is centrifuged (200 g, 3 min). The cells are then resuspended in culture medium and the cell suspension is adjusted at a density of 1  10 5 cellsml. Using a multichannel pipette, dispense 100 µl culture medium only (blank) into the peripheral wells of a 96-well tissue culture microtitre plate (  blanks, see Appendix E in Reference [1]). In the remaining wells, dispense 100 µl of a cell suspension of 1  105 cellsml (  1  104 cellswell).  Incubate cells for 24 h (5  CO2, 37 C,  90  humidity) so that cells form a half-confluent monolayer. This incubation period ensures cell recovery, and adherence and progression to exponential growth phase.  Examine each plate under a phase contrast microscope to ensure that cell growth is relatively even across the microtitre plate. This check is performed to identify experimental errors.

Per well, add 100 µl of treatment medium containing either the appropriate concentration of sample extract, or the negative control, or the PC, or nothing but blank. At least four different concentrations of the test item extract or the positive control extract should be tested. The highest concentration used should be 100  extract and the other concentrations will be adequately spaced within a single logarithmic range. For the negative control, only the 100  extract should be tested. Culture medium should be used as blank.  Incubate cells for 24 h (5  CO 2, 37 C,  90  humidity). 3rd day After 24 h treatment, examine each plate under a phase contrast microscope to identify systematic cell seeding errors and growth characteristics of control and treated cells. Record changes in the morphology of the cells due to cytotoxic effects of the test sample extract, but do not use these records for any quantitative measure of cytotoxicity. Undesirable growth characteristics of control cells can indicate experimental error and can be cause for rejection of the assay. After the examination of the plates, carefully remove the culture medium from the plates. This is an important step, because reductive chemicals in the extract can also reduce MTT, causing false negative results. 50 µl of the MTT solution (see C.2.2.4.3) is then added to each test well and the plates are further incubated for 2 h in the incubator at 37 C. Then the MTT solution is discanted and 100 µl of isopropanol are added in each well. Sway this plate and subsequently transfer it to a microplate reader equipped with a 570 nm filter to read the absorbance (reference wavelength 650 nm).

The results will be presented in tabular form, including experimental groups with the test item, negative, blank and positive controls. C.2.5 Data analysis A decrease in number of living cells results in a decrease in the metabolic activity in the sample. This decrease directly correlates to the amount of blue-violet formazan formed, as monitored by the optical density at 570 nm. To calculate the reduction of viability compared to the blank Equation (C.1) is used: 570e 570b100Viab. OD OD (C.1) where OD570e is the mean value of the measured optical density of the 100  extracts of the test sample; OD570b is the mean value of the measured optical density of the blanks. The lower the Viab. value, the higher the cytotoxic potential of the test item is. If viability is reduced to  70  of the blank, it has a cytotoxic potential. The 50  extract of the test sample should have at least the same or a higher viability than the 100  extract; otherwise the test should be repeated.

This decrease directly correlates to the amount of orange formazan formed, as monitored by the optical density at 450 nm. To calculate the reduction of viability compared to the blank, Equation (D.1) is used: 450e 450b100Viab. OD OD (D.1) where OD450e is the mean value of the measured optical density of the 100  extracts of the test sample; OD450b is the mean value of the measured optical density of the blanks. The lower the Viab.  value, the higher the cytotoxic potential of the test item is. If viability is reduced to  70  of the blank, it has a cytotoxic potential. The 50  extract of the test sample should have at least the same or a higher viability than the 100  extract; otherwise the test should be repeated.

      "text": "ISO 10993-5:2009(E) vi  ISO 2009  All rights reserved Introduction Due to the general applicability of in vitro cytotoxicity tests and their widespread use in evaluating a large range of devices and materials, it is the purpose of this part of ISO 10993, rather than to specify a single test, to define a scheme for testing which requires decisions to be made in a series of steps. This should lead to the selection of the most appropriate test. Three categories of test are listed: extract test, direct contact test, indirect contact test. The choice of one or more of these categories depends upon the nature of the sample to be evaluated, the potential site of use and the nature of the use. This choice then determines the details of the preparation of the samples to be tested, the preparation of the cultured cells, and the way in which the cells are exposed to the samples or their extracts. At the end of the exposure time, the evaluation of the presence and extent of the cytotoxic effect is undertaken. It is the intention of this part of ISO 10993 to leave open the choice of type of evaluation. Such a strategy makes available a battery of tests, which reflects the approach of many groups that advocate in vitro biological tests. The numerous methods used and endpoints measured in cytotoxicity determination can be grouped into the following categories of evaluation:  assessments of cell damage by morphological means;  measurements of cell damage;  measurements of cell growth;  measurements of specific aspects of cellular metabolism. There are several means of producing results in each of these four categories. The investigator should be aware of the test categories and into which category a particular technique fits, in order that comparisons be able to be made with other results on similar devices or materials both at the intra- and interlaboratory level. Examples of quantitative test protocols are given in annexes. Guidance for the interpretation of the results is given in this part of ISO 10993.

For example, an organotin-stabilized polyurethane1) has been used as positive control for solid materials and extracts. Dilutions of phenol, for example, have been used as a positive control for extracts . In addition to a material, pure chemicals can also be used to demonstrate the performance of the test system. 3.3 blank extraction vehicle not containing the test sample, retained in a vessel identical to that which holds the test sample and subjected to conditions identical to those to which the test sample is subjected during its extraction NOTE The purpose of the blank is to evaluate the possible confounding effects due to the extraction vessel, vehicle and extraction process. 3.4 negative control material material which, when tested in accordance with this part of ISO 10993, does not produce a cytotoxic response NOTE The purpose of the negative control is to demonstrate background response of the cells.

Due to the nature of certain materials (e.g. biodegradable materials), alteration of the chemical structure can occur during the extraction procedure. NOTE The concentration of any endogenous or extraneous substances in the extract, and hence the amount exposed to the test cells, depends on the interfacial area, the extraction volume, pH, chemical solubility, diffusion rate, osmolarity, agitation, temperature, time and other factors. For devices that involve mixing two or more components in the patient to arrive at the final device (for example bone cement), the final device should not be washed prior to extraction. Washing the test sample can reduce or remove residuals present on the device. If the test sample is to be used in a sterile environment, a sterilized test sample should be used to extract chemical constituents. 4.2.2 Extraction vehicle The choice of the extraction vehicle(s) taking into account the chemical characteristics of the test sample shall be justified and documented. For mammalian cell assays one or more of the following vehicles shall be used: a) culture medium with serum; b) physiological saline solution; c) other suitable vehicle. The choice of vehicle should reflect the aim of the extraction. Consideration shall be given to the use of both a polar and a non-polar vehicle. Culture medium with serum is the preferred extraction vehicle. The use of culture medium with serum is preferred for extraction because of its ability to support cellular growth as well as extract both polar and non-polar substances. In addition to culture medium with serum, use of medium without serum should be considered in order to specifically extract polar substances (e.g. ionic compounds). Other suitable vehicles include purified water and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). DMSO is cytotoxic in selected assay systems at greater than 0,5  (volume fraction). The cellular exposure concentration of extractables in DMSO will be lower due to the greater dilution as compared to extraction in culture medium with serum. NOTE 1 Different types of serum (e.g. foetal, bovinecalf serum, newborn calf serum) might be used and the choice of the serum is dependent on the cell type. NOTE 2 It is important to recognise that serumprotei ns are known to bind, to some extent, extractables. 4.2.3 Extraction conditions 4.2.3.1 The extraction shall be performed in sterile, chemically inert, closed containers by using aseptic techniques, in accordance with ISO 10993-12. 4.2.3.2 With the exception of circumstances given below, the extraction shall be conducted under one of the following conditions and shall be applied according to the device characteristics and specific conditions for use: a) (24  2) h at (37  1) C; b) (72  2) h at (50  2) C; c) (24  2) h at (70  2) C; d) (1  0,2) h at (121  2) C.

      "text": "ISO 10993-5:2009(E) 4  ISO 2009  All rights reserved Extraction conditions described above, which have been used to provide a measure of the hazard potential for risk estimation of the device or material, are based on historical precedent. Other conditions, e.g. prolonged or shortened extraction times at 37 C, which simulate the extraction that occurs during clinical use or provide an adequate measure of the hazard potential, may be used, but shall be justified and documented. For medical devices that are in short-term contact (no greater than 4 h cumulative contact duration) with intact skin or mucosa and that are not implanted, this may include extraction times of less than 24 h but no less than 4 h, as given in a) to c). Cell culture medium with serum should only be used in accordance with a) because extraction temperatures greater than (37  1) C can adversely impact chemistry andor stability of the serum and other constituents in the culture medium. For polymeric test samples, the extraction temperature should not exceed the glass transition temperature as the higher temperature can change the extractant composition. 4.2.3.3 If the extract is filtered, centrifuged or processed by other methods prior to being applied to the cells, these details shall be recorded in the final report along with a rationale for the additional steps (see Clause 9). Any pH adjustment of the extract shall be reported. Manipulation of the extract, such as by pH adjustment, should be avoided because it could influence the result. 4.3 Preparation of material for direct-contact tests 4.3.1 Form of test samples Materials that have various shapes, sizes or physical states (i.e. liquid, gels, solids, etc.) may be tested without modification in the cytotoxicity assays. The preferred test sample of a solid material should have at least one flat surface. If not, adjustments shall be made to achieve flat surfaces. 4.3.2 Sterility of test samples 4.3.2.1 Sterility of the test sample shall be taken into account. 4.3.2.2 Test samples from sterilized devices shall be handled aseptically throughout the test procedure. 4.3.2.3 Test samples from devices that are normally supplied non-sterile but are sterilized before use shall be sterilized by the method recommended by the manufacturer and handled aseptically throughout the test procedure. The effect of sterilization methods or agents on the device should be considered in defining the preparation of the test sample prior to use in the test system. 4.3.2.4 Test samples from devices not required to be sterile in use shall be used as supplied and handled aseptically throughout the test procedure. It may be justifiable to sterilize the test material in order to avoid microbial contamination of the cell culture; however, the sterilization process shall not alter the properties of the test material. If non-sterile test samples are used, they should be checked for bacterial contamination because the contamination can lead to a false assessment of cytotoxicity. 4.3.3 Liquid test samples Liquid test samples shall be tested by either a) direct deposition or b) deposition on a biologically inert absorbent matrix. Filter discs have bee n found to be suitable for us e as iner t absorbent matrices.

Where specific sensitivity is required, primary cell cultures, cell lines and organotypic cultures obtained directly from living tissues shall only be used if reproducibility and accuracy of the response can be demonstrated. If a stock culture of a cell line is stored, storage shall be at 80 C or below in the corresponding culture medium but containing a cryoprotectant, e.g. dimethylsu lfoxide or glycerol. Long-term storage (several months up to many years) is only possible at 130 C or below. Only cells free from mycoplasma shall be used for the test. Before use, stock cultures should be tested for the absence of mycoplasma. It is important to check cells regularly (e.g. morphology, doubling time, modal chromosome number) because sensitivity in tests can vary with passage number. Good cell culture practices should be used. See Reference [5]. 6 Culture medium The culture medium shall be sterile. The culture medium with or without serum shall meet the growth requirements of the selected cell line. Antibiotics may be included in the medium provided that they do not adversely affect the assays. Storage conditions shall be validated. NOTE The stability of the culture medium varies with the composition and storage conditions. The culture medium shall be maintained at a pH of between 7,2 and 7,4. 3) For example, cell lines American Type Culture Collection CCL 1 (NCTC clone 929), CCL 163 (Balb3T3 clone A31), CCL 171 (MRC-5) and CCL 75 (WI-38), CCL 81 (Vero) and CCL 10 [BHK-21 (C-13) ] and V-79 379A are endorsed by ISO experts to be suitable.

Distribute the cells evenly over the surface of each vessel by gentle rotation. 8.2.3 Incubate the cultures at (37  1) C in air with or without carbon dioxide as appropriate for the buffer system chosen for the culture medium. The test should be performed on a subconfluent monolayer or on freshly suspended cells. In the colony-forming assay only an appropriate low cell density shall be used. 8.2.4 Verify the subconfluency and the morphology of the cultures with a microscope before starting the test. In exceptional cases, exponentially growing cells (e.g. primary cells, high proliferating cells) may be seeded at the starting point of the test. 8.2.5 Perform the test on a) the original extract andor b) the original extract and a dilution series of the extracts using the extract vehicle as diluent. Alternatively, where materials of limited solubility are known or suspected to be present, dilution should be achieved by varying the original extraction ratio of test sample to extraction medium. If monolayers are used for the test, remove and discard the culture medium from the cultures and add an aliquot of the extract or dilution thereof into each of the vessels. If suspended cells are used for the test, add the extract or dilution thereof into each of the replicate vessels, immediately after preparation of the cell suspension. 8.2.6 When a non-physiological extract is used, e.g. water, the extract shall be tested at the highest physiologically compatible concentration after dilution in culture medium. NOTE Concentrated culture medium, e.g. 2 , 5, is recommended for use in diluting aqueous extracts.

Quantitative evaluation of cytotoxicity is preferable. Qualitative means are appropriate for screening purposes. Qualitative evaluation: Examine the cells microscopically using cytochemical staining if desired. Assess changes in, for example, general morphology, vacuolization, detachment, cell lysis and membrane integrity. The change from normal morphology shall be recorded in the test report descriptively or numerically. A useful way to grade test samples is given in Tables 1 and 2. Table 1  Qualitative morphological grading of cytotoxicity of extracts Grade Reactivity Conditions of all cultures 0 None Discrete intracytoplasmatic granules, no cell lysis, no reduction of cell growth 1 Slight Not more than 20  of the cells are round, loosely attached and without intracytoplasmatic granules, or show changes in morphology; occasional lysed cells are present; only slight growth inhibition observable. 2 Mild Not more than 50  of the cells are round, devoid of intracytoplasmatic granules, no extensive cell lysis; not more than 50  growth inhibition observable. 3 Moderate Not more than 70  of the cell layers contain rounded cells or are lysed; cell layers not completly destroyed, but more than 50  growth inhibition observable. 4 Severe Nearly complete or complete destruction of the cell layers. Table 2  Reactivity grades for agar and filter diffusion test and direct contact test Grade Reactivity Description of reactivity zone 0 None No detectable zone around or under specimen 1 Slight Some malformed or degenerated cells under specimen 2 Mild Zone limited to area under specimen 3 Moderate Zone extending specimen size up to 1,0 cm 4 Severe Zone extending farther than 1,0 cm beyond specimen The method of evaluation and the results of the evaluation shall be included in the test report. The achievement of a numerical grade greater than 2, based on Tables 1 and 2, is considered a cytotoxic effect. Quantitative evaluation: Measure cell death, inhibition of cell growth, cell proliferation or colony formation. The number of cells, amount of protein, release of enzymes, release of vital dye, reduction of vital dye or any other measurable parameter may be quantified by objective means. The objective measure and response shall be recorded in the test report. Reduction of cell viability by more than 30  is considered a cytotoxic effect. Other criteria, including different cut-off points or an acceptable ratio of test-to-control result shall be justified for alternate cell lines or multi-layered tissue constructs. The criteria shall be justified and documented. The protocols described in Annexes A to D may be used for the quantitative determination of cytotoxicity of extracts. NOTE Protocols A and B have been proven to be suitable for chemicals in international validation studies and for medical devices in an international round-robin test. For cytotoxic materials, they permit the graduation of the cytotoxic effect by the calculation of an IC50 value (inhibitory concentration estimated to affect the endpoint in question by 50 ). Annexes C and D describe other protocols widely used for the quantitative determination of cytotoxicity.

A.2 Experimental procedure A.2.1 Basic procedure BALBc 3T3 cells are seeded into 96-well plates and maintained in culture for 24 h (  1 doubling period) to form a semi-confluent monolayer (see Reference [5] for more information on cell maintenance and culture procedures). They are then exposed to the test compound over a range of concentrations. After 24 h exposure, NRU is determined for each treatment concent ration and compared to that determined in control cultures. For each treatment (i.e. concentration of the test chemical), the inhibition of growth percentage is calculated, if the extract exhibits a cytotoxic effect on the cells. The IC 50 (i.e. the concentration producing 50  reduction of NRU) is calculated from the concentration-response and expressed as a dilution percentage of the extract. The neat extract is designated as 100  extract.

A.2.3.2 Quality check of assay (I); positive control (PC) A positive control shall be included in every cytotoxicity test. With regard to the many chemicals backed by sufficient history or intra- and interlaboratory repeat tests, sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS, CAS  151-21-3) is one of the most frequently tested, and is therefore recommended as a PC. It is recommended that SLS be tested in a four-concentration scale: 0,05 mgml; 0,1 mgml; 0,15 mgml; 0,2 mgml. The historical mean, IC50, of SLS (Spielmann et. al., 1991 [10]) is 0,093 mgml. The 95  CI (confidence interval) is 0,070 mgml to 0,116 mgml. A test meets acceptance criteria, if the IC50 for SLS is within the 95  CI. The use of positive reference materials and negative reference materials is recommended [e.g. ZDEC and ZDBC (see footnote 1 on page 2 and 3.2 and 3.4)]. A.2.3.3 Quality check of assay (II); blank The absolute value (not relative to the blank) of optical density ( OD540 of NRU) obtained in the untreated blank indicates whether the 1 104 cells seeded per well have grown exponentially with normal doubling time during the two days of the assay.

A test meets acceptance criteria if the left and the right mean of the blanks do not differ by more than 15  from the mean of all blanks. Checks for cell seeding errors may also be performed by examining each plate under a phase contrast microscope to ensure that cell quantity is consistent. Microscopic evaluation obviates the need for two rows of blanks. A.2.3.4 Quality check of concentration-response The IC 50 derived from the concentration-response should be supported by at least two, or if possible, three responses between 10  and 90  inhibition of NRU. If this is not the case, and the concentration progression factor can be easily reduced, reject the experiment and repeat it with a smaller progression factor. A.2.3.5 Concentrations of test sample extracts A.2.3.5.1 Range finder experiment Test eight concentrations of the sample extract by diluting the stock solution with a constant factor, covering a large range, e.g. half-log intervals. If the reduction of viability of the cell culture with the highest concentration of the sample extract is 30  or less, then the material has to be considered non-cytotoxic and no further main experiment is necessary. A.2.3.5.2 Main experiment Depending on the slope of the concentration-response curve estimated from the range finder, the dilutionprogression factor in the concentration series of the main experiment should be smaller (e.g. 610 1 ,47 ). Try to cover the relevant concentration range (between 10  and 90  effect) with at least three points of a graded effect, avoiding too many non-cytotoxic andor 100 -cytotoxic concentrations. A.2.3.6 Test procedure IMPORTANT  After thawing from stock, passage two to three times before using the cells in the test. Table A.1 shows the work flow of the test procedure. 1st day  Prepare a cell suspension of 1  105 cellsml in culture medium. Using a multichannel pipette, dispense 100 µl culture medium only into the peripheral wells of a 96-well tissue culture microtitre plate (  blanks, see Appendix E in Reference [1]). In the remaining wells, dispense 100 µl of a cell suspension of 1  105 cellsml (  1  104 cellswell). Prepare one plate per sample extract to be tested, one plate for the PC and one plate for the negative control material if available.  Incubate cells for 24 h (5  CO2, 37 C,  90  humidity) so that cells form a half-confluent monolayer. This incubation period ensures cell recovery, and adherence and progression to exponential growth phase.  Examine each plate under a phase contrast microscope to ensure that cell growth is relatively even across the microtitre plate. This check is performed to identify experimental errors.

Incubate cells for 24 h (5  CO2, 37 C,  90  humidity). 3rd day After 24 h treatment, examine each plate under a phase contrast microscope to identify systematic cell seeding errors and growth characteristics of control and treated cells.

Shake the microtitre plate rapidly on a microtitre plate shaker for 10 min until NR has been extracted from the cells and forms a homogeneous solution.  Measure the absorption of the resulting coloured solution at 540 nm in a microtitre plate reader, using the blanks as a reference. Save raw data in a file format (e.g. ASCII, TXT, XLS) appropriate for further analysis of the concentration-response and calculation of IC 50. A.2.4 Data analysis A calculation of cell viability expressed as NRU is made for each concentration of the test sample extract by using the mean NRU of the six replicate values per test concentration. This value is compared with the mean NRU of all blank values (provided blanks have met the blank acceptance criteria). Relative cell viability is then expressed as a percentage of untreated blank. If achievable, the eight concentrations of each compound tested should span the range of no effect up to total inhibition of cell viability.

Yellow water-soluble MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromid) is metabolically reduced in viable cells to a blue-violet insoluble formazan. The number of viable cells correlates to the colour intensity determined by photometric measurements after dissolving the formazan in alcohol. C.2 Experimental procedure C.2.1 Basic procedure L929 cells are seeded into 96-well plates and maintained in culture for 24 h (  1 doubling period) to form a semi-confluent monolayer (see Reference [5] for more information on cell maintenance and culture procedures). They are then exposed to the test compound over a range of concentrations. After 24 h exposure, the formazan formation is determined for each treatment concentration and compared to that determined in control cultures.

C.2.3.3 Quality check of assay (II); blank The absolute value of optical density, OD570, obtained in the untreated blank indicates whether the 1  104 cells seeded per well have grown exponentially with normal doubling time during the two days of the assay.

A test meets acceptance criteria if the left and the right mean of the blanks do not differ by more than 15  from the mean of all blanks. Checks for cell seeding errors may also be performed by examining each plate under a phase contrast microscope to ensure that cell quantity is consistent. Microscopic evaluation obviates the need for two rows of blanks. C.2.3.4 Test procedure IMPORTANT  After thawing from stock, passage two to three times before using the cells in the test. Table C.1 shows the work flow of the test procedure. 1st day after growing up the cells from frozen stock  Cell cultures are removed from culture flasks by enzymatic digestion (trypsinEDTA) and the cell suspension is centrifuged (200 g, 3 min). The cells are then resuspended in culture medium and the cell suspension is adjusted at a density of 1  10 5 cellsml. Using a multichannel pipette, dispense 100 µl culture medium only (blank) into the peripheral wells of a 96-well tissue culture microtitre plate (  blanks, see Appendix E in Reference [1]). In the remaining wells, dispense 100 µl of a cell suspension of 1  105 cellsml (  1  104 cellswell).  Incubate cells for 24 h (5  CO2, 37 C,  90  humidity) so that cells form a half-confluent monolayer. This incubation period ensures cell recovery, and adherence and progression to exponential growth phase.  Examine each plate under a phase contrast microscope to ensure that cell growth is relatively even across the microtitre plate. This check is performed to identify experimental errors.

Per well, add 100 µl of treatment medium containing either the appropriate concentration of sample extract, or the negative control, or the PC, or nothing but blank. At least four different concentrations of the test item extract or the positive control extract should be tested. The highest concentration used should be 100  extract and the other concentrations will be adequately spaced within a single logarithmic range. For the negative control, only the 100  extract should be tested. Culture medium should be used as blank.  Incubate cells for 24 h (5  CO 2, 37 C,  90  humidity). 3rd day After 24 h treatment, examine each plate under a phase contrast microscope to identify systematic cell seeding errors and growth characteristics of control and treated cells. Record changes in the morphology of the cells due to cytotoxic effects of the test sample extract, but do not use these records for any quantitative measure of cytotoxicity. Undesirable growth characteristics of control cells can indicate experimental error and can be cause for rejection of the assay. After the examination of the plates, carefully remove the culture medium from the plates. This is an important step, because reductive chemicals in the extract can also reduce MTT, causing false negative results. 50 µl of the MTT solution (see C.2.2.4.3) is then added to each test well and the plates are further incubated for 2 h in the incubator at 37 C. Then the MTT solution is discanted and 100 µl of isopropanol are added in each well. Sway this plate and subsequently transfer it to a microplate reader equipped with a 570 nm filter to read the absorbance (reference wavelength 650 nm).

The results will be presented in tabular form, including experimental groups with the test item, negative, blank and positive controls. C.2.5 Data analysis A decrease in number of living cells results in a decrease in the metabolic activity in the sample. This decrease directly correlates to the amount of blue-violet formazan formed, as monitored by the optical density at 570 nm. To calculate the reduction of viability compared to the blank Equation (C.1) is used: 570e 570b100Viab. OD OD (C.1) where OD570e is the mean value of the measured optical density of the 100  extracts of the test sample; OD570b is the mean value of the measured optical density of the blanks. The lower the Viab. value, the higher the cytotoxic potential of the test item is. If viability is reduced to  70  of the blank, it has a cytotoxic potential. The 50  extract of the test sample should have at least the same or a higher viability than the 100  extract; otherwise the test should be repeated.

Solution is sterilized by sterile filtration using syringe filters (pore size u 0,22 µm). PMS (phenazine metosulfate) is made as a solution of 5 mM in PBS buffer and sterile filtered through a 0,22 µm sterile filter. PMS solution is added to the XTT solution shortly before usage in a concentration of 25 µM (5 µml of a 5 mM PMSml XTT solution). The XTTPMS solution is then immediately added to the test wells. D.2.2.4.4 Preparation of sample extract Samples are extracted in accordance with ISO 10993-12, using MEM without phenol red and with FBS. D.2.3 Methods D.2.3.1 General For routine cell culture methods, see Annex C of Reference [1]. D.2.3.2 Quality check of assay (I); positive control (PC) and negative control (NC) Positive and negative controls shall be included in every cytotoxicity test. Positive and negative reference materials are recommended, e.g. ZDEC and ZDBC (see footnote 1 on page 2). D.2.3.3 Quality check of assay (II); blank The absolute value of optical density ( OD450) obtained in the untreated blank indicates whether the 1  104 cells seeded per well have grown exponentially with normal doubling time during the two days of the assay. A test meets the acceptance criteria if the mean OD450 of blanks is W 0,2. To check for systematic cell seeding errors, blanks are placed both at the left side (row 2) and the right side (row 11) of the 96-well plate (row 1 and row 12 shall not be used; for plate layout, see Annex E in Reference [1]). A test meets acceptance criteria if the left and the right mean of the blanks do not differ by more than 15  from the mean of all blanks. Checks for cell seeding errors may also be performed by examining each plate under a phase contrast microscope to ensure that cell quantity is consistent. Microscopic evaluation obviates the need for two rows of blanks. D.2.3.4 Test procedure IMPORTANT  After thawing from stock, passage two to three times before using the cells in the test. Table D.1 shows the work flow of the test procedure. 1st day after growing up the cells from frozen stock  Cell cultures are removed from culture flasks by enzymatic digestion (trypsinEDTA) and the cell suspension is centrifuged (200 g, 3 min). The cells are then resuspended in culture medium and the cell suspension is adjusted at a density of 1  10 5 cellsml. Using a multichannel pipette, dispense 100 µl culture medium only (blank) into the peripheral wells of a 96-well tissue culture microtitre plate (  blanks, see Appendix E in Reference [1]). In the remaining wells, dispense 100 µl of a cell suspension of 1  105 cellsml (  1  104 cellswell).

This incubation period ensures cell recovery, and adherence and progression to exponential growth phase.  Examine each plate under a phase contrast microscope to ensure that cell growth is relatively even across the microtitre plate. This check is performed to identify experimental errors. 2nd day  After 24 h incubation, aspirate culture medium from the cells.  Per well, add 100 µl of treatment medium containing either the appropriate concentration of sample extract, or the negative control, or the PC, or nothing but blank. At least four different concentrations of the test item extract or the positive control extract should be tested. The highest concentration used should be 100  extract and the other concentrations will be adequately spaced within a single logarithmic range. For the negative control, only the 100  extract should be tested. Culture medium should be used as blank.  Incubate cells for 24 h (5  CO 2, 37 C,  90  humidity). 3rd day After 24 h treatment, examine each plate under a phase contrast microscope to identify systematic cell seeding errors and growth characteristics of control and treated cells. Record changes in morphology of the cells due to cytotoxic effects of the test sample extract, but do not use these records for any quantitative measure of cytotoxicity. Undesirable growth characteristics of control cells can indicate experimental error and can be cause for rejection of the assay. After examination of the plates, 50 µl of the XTTPMS solution is added to each test well and the plates are further incubated for 3 h to 5 h in the incubator at 37 C. Plates should be kept in a dark environment. Then the plates are swayed carefully and an aliquot of 100 µl is transferred from each well into the corresponding well of a new plate and this plate is subsequently transferred to a microplate reader equipped with a 450 nm filter to read the absorbance (reference wavelength 630 nm).

The results shall be presented in tabular form, including experimental groups with the test item, negative control, blank and positive controls. D.2.5 Data analysis A decrease in number of living cells results in a decrease in the overall activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenases in the sample. This decrease directly correlates to the amount of orange formazan formed, as monitored by the optical density at 450 nm. To calculate the reduction of viability compared to the blank, Equation (D.1) is used: 450e 450b100Viab. OD OD (D.1) where OD450e is the mean value of the measured optical density of the 100  extracts of the test sample; OD450b is the mean value of the measured optical density of the blanks. The lower the Viab.  value, the higher the cytotoxic potential of the test item is. If viability is reduced to  70  of the blank, it has a cytotoxic potential. The 50  extract of the test sample should have at least the same or a higher viability than the 100  extract; otherwise the test should be repeated.

This should lead to the selection of the most appropriate test. Three categories of test are listed: extract test, direct contact test, indirect contact test. The choice of one or more of these categories depends upon the nature of the sample",
    "ct contact test. The choice of one or more of these categories depends upon the nature of the sample to be evaluated, the potential site of use and the nature of the use. This choice then determines the details of the preparation of the samples to be tested, the preparation of the cultured cells, and the way in which the cells are exposed to the samples or their extracts. At the end of the exposure time, the evaluation of the presence and extent of the cytotoxic effect is undertaken. It is the intention of this part of ISO 10993 to leave open the choice of type of evaluation. Such a strategy makes available a battery of tests, which reflects the approach of many groups that advocate in vitro biological tests. The numerous methods used and endpoints measured in cytotoxicity determination can be grouped into the following categories of evaluation:  assessments of cell damage by morphological means;  measurements of cell damage;  measurements of cell growth;  measurements of specific aspects",
    "means;  measurements of cell damage;  measurements of cell growth;  measurements of specific aspects of cellular metabolism. There are several means of producing results in each of these four categories. The investigator should be aware of the test categories and into which category a particular technique fits, in order that comparisons be able to be made with other results on similar devices or materials both at the intra- and interlaboratory level. Examples of quantitative test protocols are given in annexes. Guidance for the interpretation of the results is given in this part of ISO 10993.

Due to the nature of certain materials (e.g. biodegradable materials), alteration of the chemical structure can occur during the extraction procedure. NOTE The concentration of any endogenous or extraneous substances in the extract, and hence the amount exposed to the test cells, depends on the interfacial area, the extraction volume, pH, chemical solubility, diffusion rate, osmolarity, agitation, temperature, time and other factors.

For devices that involve mixing two or more components in the patient to arrive at the final device (for example bone cement), the final device should not be washed prior to extraction. Washing the test sample can reduce or remove residuals present on the device. If the test sample is to be used in a sterile environment, a sterilized test sample should be used to extract chemical constituents. 4.2.2 Extraction vehicle The choice of the extraction vehicle(s) taking into account the chemical characteristics of the test sample shall be justified and documented. For mammalian cell assays one or more of the following vehicles shall be used: a) culture medium with serum; b) physiological saline solution; c) other suitable vehicle.

In addition to culture medium with serum, use of medium without serum should be considered in order to specifically extract polar substances (e.g. ionic compounds). Other suitable vehicles include purified water and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). DMSO is cytotoxic in selected assay systems at greater than 0,5  (volume fraction). The cellular exposure concentration of extractables in DMSO will be lower due to the greater dilution as compared to extraction in culture medium with serum.

    "egard to the many chemicals backed by sufficient history or intra- and interlaboratory repeat tests, sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS, CAS  151-21-3) is one of the most frequently tested, and is therefore recommended as a PC. It is recommended that SLS be tested in a four-concentration scale: 0,05 mgml; 0,1 mgml; 0,15 mgml; 0,2 mgml. The historical mean, IC50, of SLS (Spielmann et. al., 1991 [10]) is 0,093 mgml. The 95  CI (confidence interval) is 0,070 mgml to 0,116 mgml. A test meets acceptance criteria, if the IC50 for SLS is within the 95  CI. The use of positive reference materials and negative reference materials is recommended [e.g. ZDEC and ZDBC (see footnote 1 on page 2 and 3.2 and 3.4)].

This value is compared with the mean NRU of all blank values (provided blanks have met the blank acceptance criteria). Relative cell viability is then expressed as a percentage of untreated blank.
